    "## Summary of Optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored four different optimization algorithms: vanilla gradient descent, Adagrad, RMSProp, and Adam. Here are the key insights for each optimizer:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vanilla Gradient Descent\n",
    "* Vanilla gradient descent is a basic optimization algorithm that updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "* It uses a fixed learning rate for all parameters.\n",
    "* It can suffer from the problem of exploding or vanishing gradients if the learning rate is not properly chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adagrad\n",
    "* Adagrad is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradients.\n",
    "* It accumulates the squared gradients and uses them to scale the learning rate.\n",
    "* It performs well on sparse datasets where some parameters are updated infrequently.\n",
    "* However, it may have difficulty converging if the accumulated gradients become too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RMSProp\n",
    "* RMSProp is an adaptive optimization algorithm that addresses the convergence issues of Adagrad.\n",
    "* It uses a moving average of squared gradients to adjust the learning rate for each parameter.\n",
    "* The decay rate controls the influence of past gradients on the adjustment.\n",
    "* It performs well in practice and is widely used in deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adam\n",
    "* Adam combines the best features of RMSProp and momentum-based optimization.\n",
    "* It maintains both a moving average of gradients and a moving average of squared gradients.\n",
    "* It adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on these moving averages.\n",
    "* Adam is known for its good performance and fast convergence in many deep learning tasks."
