    "A decision problem is a computational problem that requires a yes-or-no answer. It involves determining whether a given input satisfies a specific property or condition. The goal is to determine whether a solution exists for a given instance of the problem. In the context of complexity theory, decision problems are often used to classify computational problems into different complexity classes, such as P (problems that can be solved in polynomial time) and NP (problems for which a solution can be verified in polynomial time).\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, P (Polynomial Time) refers to the class of **decision problems** that can be **solved** by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. This means that there exists an algorithm that can solve the problem in a time complexity that is polynomial in the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time) refers to the class of **decision problems** for which a solution can be **verified** in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. This means that given a potential solution, there exists an algorithm that can verify whether the solution is correct or not in a time complexity that is polynomial in the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between P and NP is a fundamental question in computer science. The P vs NP problem asks whether every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time. In other words, it asks whether P = NP. This problem remains unsolved, and it is considered one of the most important open questions in computer science."
